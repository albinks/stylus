## Known Issues

### ðŸŸ¡ Technical Challenges
1. **AI Model Coordination**
   - **Issue**: Maintaining visual consistency across multiple AI-generated images
   - **Impact**: Medium - affects output quality
   - **Plan**: Implement character embedding persistence and style validation

2. **API Rate Limits**
   - **Issue**: External AI services have usage limits
   - **Impact**: Medium - affects generation speed
   - **Plan**: Implement caching, batching, and fallback mechanisms

3. **Memory Management**
   - **Issue**: Large image generation can consume significant memory
   - **Impact**: Low - affects scalability
   - **Plan**: Implement streaming and cleanup patterns

### ðŸŸ¢ Resolved Decisions
1. **Package Management**: Poetry selected over pip for better dependency resolution
2. **Documentation**: MkDocs chosen over Sphinx for simplicity and speed
3. **Testing**: pytest with coverage selected for comprehensive testing
4. **Code Quality**: Black + Ruff + mypy toolchain established

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Scope Refinements
- **Original**: Generic comic creation tool
- **Refined**: News-to-comic and prompt-to-comic specialized pipeline
- **Reason**: Focused scope enables better quality within 3k LOC constraint

### Architecture Evolution
- **Original**: Monolithic generation function
- **Refined**: Multi-agent pipeline with shared context
- **Reason**: Better separation of concerns and testability

### Technology Stack Decisions
- **Python Version**: 3.12 selected for latest type hints and performance
- **AI Integration**: API-first approach with local fallbacks
- **Documentation**: Auto-generation prioritized for maintenance efficiency

## Metrics & Tracking

### Development Velocity
- **Sessions Completed**: 1 (Infrastructure Implementation Complete)
- **Lines of Code**: ~500 (infrastructure and configuration)
- **Test Coverage**: 100% (basic package tests operational)
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% (memory bank complete, MkDocs operational)

### Quality Metrics (Targets)
- **Test Coverage**: Target 85% minimum
- **Type Coverage**: Target 100% on public APIs
- **Code Complexity**: Maximum cyclomatic complexity of 10
- **Performance**: 4-6 page comic in under 10 minutes

### User Experience Metrics (Future)
- **Generation Success Rate**: Target 95%
- **User Satisfaction**: Target 80%+ positive feedback
- **Iteration Speed**: Target <30 seconds for refinements
- **Error Recovery**: Target 90% successful recoveries

## Next Session Priorities

### Immediate Actions (Session 2)
**Infrastructure Complete âœ… - Ready for Agent Implementation**

1. **Base Agent Framework**: Implement `BaseAgent` abstract class with standard interface
2. **Context Management**: Create `ComicContext` shared state management system
3. **Core Schemas**: Define Pydantic models for data flow between agents (Character, Story, Panel, Comic)
4. **Logging Infrastructure**: Set up structured logging and error handling

### Success Criteria for Next Session
- âœ… Python package can be installed with `poetry install` (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Development environment is fully functional (COMPLETE)
- [ ] Basic agent framework is testable
- [ ] Core schemas validate expected data structures
- [ ] Logging and error handling infrastructure operational

### Risk Mitigation
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features only in Phase 1
- **Over-Engineering**: Implement simplest solution that works
- **Technical Debt**: Maintain test coverage from the start
- **Documentation Lag**: Update memory bank with each major change

The project is well-positioned for rapid development with clear priorities and a solid foundation.
